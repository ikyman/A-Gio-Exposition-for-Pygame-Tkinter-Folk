If you're reading this, you're doubtless aware of the sample code, guiInTkinter.py
Do you need to read it? Not particularly. Not only am I assumning the reader already has a baseline working knowledge on writing tkinter code, 
I will also do my very best to stuff enough MS Paint drawings into this explainer to expediate all explinations for this explainer.

# No user interation
Take the "Hello World" program: It runs. It exits. 
It ignores you and I. Once the user runs it, they can but watch.
This isn't ideal. I am a user, and I demand to be pampered!
# Text-based user interaction
Many programs give the user a command line and tell tham to get on with it. For many years, up to and including now, this was to program than a GUI. 
An example of a program with text-based interation:
`
[do you wish to add a (b)utton or (m)ove the shape? > m
[which direction should the shape move? > s
[your shape has moved 5 units south, and is now positioned at (10, 15) 
==Program Exited==
`

You might spot one minor pecadillo with this program: what if I want to move the shape twice?
I can't due to the structure of the program:





# mainloop()
