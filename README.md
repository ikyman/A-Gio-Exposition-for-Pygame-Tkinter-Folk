# A-Gio-Exposition-for-Pygame-Tkinter-Folk
An Tutorial/Overview of Python's GUI Libraries, and a Compare &amp; Contrast with Go's GIO.

# The GUI Application
Henceforth, our program, the one which will be discussed and trilingually translated, is as thus:
You are greeted with a screen, with a shape and a button:
<img width="410" height="332" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60ba38cf-9496-4c94-b4b5-95b416bf8297" />

Using WASD Moves the shape. Simple enough.

Your eyes may focus upon the button: If you click that, what doe you get? A second button. 
But wait? Now that this secret second button is revealed, what does that button do? It creates a third button. 
In fact, if you click the second button a second time, you get a fourth button.

This isn't some grand button puzzle: Any button, including future buttons, adds a new button. Simple enough.
Indeed, the whole point of this app is to be "Simple Enough"

Of especially valued feedback are the following:
If, by some odd sequence of events, you, dispite being on LinkdIn, are a non-coder, your feedback is prized above all. I decree that this Tutorial should be Suis Generus (E.G. Je ne sans pas) be a jolly good read. Something one would conceivably read even without the urges of GUI-making bearing down upon them. Thus, I would very much any non-programmers feedback on the per-se entertainment value of this informative tutorial

More mundane matters, the structure of this tutorial is focused on a core on Tkinter. The unique perspective is explaining how the other GUI Libraries relate to Tkinter. Tkinter is the library I've Tinkered with most of all. I have less experience with pygame, and this very tutorial shall be my first GIO App.

Judgement on either field would also be Top-Notch.

Lastly, if public is clamoring for it, I will add a React Section to this tutorial.
