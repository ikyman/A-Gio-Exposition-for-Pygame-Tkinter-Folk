# UIElements Folder

First of all, you may be wondering why there's a "UIElements" folder. 
The answer is quite simple: Pygame doesn't have any built-in UI elements. On one hand, this may be annoying.
On the other hand, I took a quite refresher of my collection of video games and found that no two had exactly the same UI.

This lack fo UI elements could be worse: Imagene, for example, the most popular developer platform, a company with billions of dollars of revinue, millions of users, and thousands of employes failed to integrate Spellcheck.
Imagine again, that that very same company got purchased by microsoft, yet fials to be able to read Word documents.

Now that, that would be an embaressment! Far more of a ball-dropping than a Game library not implementing UI elements on the assumption that no two games would have the same UI!

Luckily, I used the programmer's favorite trick: The trusty ol' Copy-Paste! Voila! No AI "Vibe Coding" Required!

I will not give a comprehensive review of what my UI elements are, for multiple reasons.
1. This is really a Gio GUI tutorial, with only a stop-by on tkinter and Pygame
2. They should work, shouldn't they? 
3. I aim for this tutorial to emphisize the codebase as little as possible. I started off with Tkinter for program conceptualization.
   From said conceptualization, from the structure of the program, I aim to show the simularities of all three programs.
   Think think with the mindset, see how the concepts fit together.
